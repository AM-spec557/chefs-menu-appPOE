In part part 2, we added the logic like the dish name, description, select the course, and the price.
For this final attempt, i have added an app feature that displays the average price of the menu items.
Then a separate screen show casing for adding the menu items.
With that we have menu items saved in an array and allowed to remove items.
Then another separate page that allows the guest to filter by cause. 
Updated the user design interface with adding light colours and more fancy.
